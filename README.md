# ‚ôüÔ∏è SQL Project: Online Chess Platform Database

## ‚ú® Summary  
This project designs and implements a **complete relational database system** for an online chess platform using **Oracle SQL** and **PL/SQL**.  
The work began with a **fully modeled relational diagram**, capturing every entity, key, and assumption of the platform before moving to SQL implementation.  

The database manages players, games, tournaments, clubs, teams, leagues, chats, and rewards ‚Äî supporting realistic logic for tracking player performance, tournament activity, and reward management.  
Finally, the project integrates **automated triggers** and **analytical queries** to simulate platform dynamics and generate leaderboard insights.

## üß© Conceptual & Relational Design  
- Designed a **complete relational model** using *draw.io*, with more than 20 entities and clear key relationships.  
- Defined **domain constraints** (e.g., tournament type, gift category, result values).  
- Modeled **business assumptions**, such as:  
  - Tournament results cannot be recorded before the match date.  
  - Player ratings start at 1500 and change dynamically through triggers.  
  - Gifts can only be purchased if sufficient points and stock exist.  

This stage ensured data consistency and logical integrity before writing a single SQL statement.

## üèÜ Core Achievements & Contributions  

**Relational Schema Implementation**  
- Created normalized database structure for **PLAYERS**, **TOURNAMENTS**, **GAMES**, **CLUBS**, **TEAMS**, **GIFTS**, and **LEAGUES**.  
- Enforced referential integrity through **primary keys**, **foreign keys**, and **check constraints**.  

**Inheritance & Data Abstraction**  
- Implemented entity inheritance for `GIFT`, with two child tables: `MERCHANDISING` and `ONLINE_FEATURE`.  

**Business Logic Automation (Triggers)**  
- `BUY_GIFT`: Validates player rating and stock before purchase; updates both after confirmation.  
- `UPDATE_PLAYER_RATINGS`: Adjusts player scores automatically after each game.  
- `CHECK_PLAYERS_IN_CLUB`: Verifies player membership before inserting new game data.  
- `CODE_ASSIGNER`: Uses sequences to auto-assign club identifiers.  

**Data & Testing**  
- Inserted **150+ sample records** simulating active players, matches, and tournaments.  
- Validated logic through integrity checks and trigger testing.  

**Analytical Queries**  
- Generated player performance reports and club rankings.  
- Computed tournament participation metrics and white/black win ratios.  
- Analyzed gift purchasing trends over time.
